Scaling a raster dataset consists on re-distributes pixels values over a wider or narrower range of values, this is a linear stretch from lowest value to highest value.

Scale operation can be used to normalize the values according to raster range of values capacity defines by raster bit depth.

Stretching can for instance be used to enhance the contrast when DEM raster dataset is displayed.In Blender a non scaled 16 bit DEM appear fully black because the elevation values are very small compared to the highest 16 bit value (65535). With a scaled DEM we can see the elevation change.

Working with scaled data help to understand the texture that will be used for displace the mesh, the advantage is only aesthetic and convenient for the user.
