This part of Blender GIS is designed to assist in the analysis of the topography : height, slope and azimuth (aspect).

A first tool to [[build materials nodes setup|Materials node setup builder]] for Cycles. These nodes setup use color ramp to analysis geometry properties of the mesh.

A second tool to [[configure the color ramp|Reclassify color gradient]] as usual in common GIS software. This tool allows to reclassify values following specified rules and allows to apply color ramp presets defined in SVG files.
