In node editor when a color ramp node is selected a new panel named Reclassify appear in editor properties sheft.

The main purpose of the panel is to help the user to setting the color ramp stops. Color ramp node input values must be range from 0 to 1, so it's hard to make the realationship between theses normalized values and a physical value like height, slope or aspect.

Values display in reclassify panel are converted to represents their physical equivalent. To compute this correctly the user must choose the display mode of the panel according to the currently applied materials.

* **Height** mode scale the values according to the object bounding box to get the true altitude
* **Slope** mode multiply the node value by 100 to get the slope in degrees (as explained in node setup description for slope material)
* **Aspect** mode multiply the value by 360 to get azimuth angle (with north = 0Â°)

**Use SVG gradient**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/domlysz/blenderGIS/images/analysis_reclassify_svg_gradient.jpg)

This addon is packaged with a few SVG color ramp. All these ramp are pick up from the [cpt-city archive](http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/). SVG files are stored in *Blender_install_folder\2.xx\scripts\addons\terrain_analysis\gradients*. You can add, edit or remove svg file from here to manage your color ramp library.

**Export to SVG**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/domlysz/blenderGIS/images/analysis_reclassify_export_svg.jpg)

You can export actual color ramp node configuration to svg files. This file will be stored in *Blender_install_folder\2.xx\scripts\addons\terrain_analysis\gradients* folder, so the ramp is added to the library and can be immediatly reused.

There are 2 methods to build the svg file:
* *Use actual stops*
* *Interpolate n colors*

SVG gradient can be continuous or discrete

The interpolation options is only used when you choose *Interpolate n colors* method.

**Auto reclass**

Description to do

**Color space and interpolation method**

Interpolation can be computed through RGB or HSV color space. HSV interpolation often gives better results, but in this color space hue is cyclic and the interpolation must be done through the shortest path (clockwise or counterclockwise). By defaut this addon use the shortest path.

You can use several algorithms for interpolation:
* **Linear** is the most simple way but this method do not provides a smooth interpolation.
* **Spline** interpolation gives smooth results. Here we use the Akima method instead of the well know Cubic spline. The disadvantage of cubic splines is that they could oscillate in the neighborhood of an outlier while the Akima spline is less affected by them.

* **Discrete** isn't an interpolation method, it just return the previous color.
* **Nearest** isn't an interpolation method, it just return the nearest color.
