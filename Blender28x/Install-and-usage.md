**Warning** : for Linux users who choose to install Blender through [`ppa:thomas-schiex/blender`](https://launchpad.net/~thomas-schiex/+archive/ubuntu/blender), Numpy will fails if your distribution does not support Python 3.6. It can be solved by reinstalling Numpy with pip : `sudo apt-get install python-pip python3-pip` and then `sudo pip3 install -U numpy`
