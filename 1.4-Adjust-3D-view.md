All import tools provide an option named *Adjust grid size*.

This option can be used to adjust 3d view according to the imported mesh size. This is especially useful because geographic data can be very large while default 3d view settings are not suitable for such scales.
	
*Adjust grid size* will **adjust 3D view grid and clip distances**.
