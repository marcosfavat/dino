This tool can import in Blender most of shapefile feature type : point, pointZ, polyline, polylineZ, polygon, polygonZ. But actually it cannot import multipoint, multipointZ, pointM, polylineM, polygonM and multipatch.

**Setting elevation or extrusion with attributes data**

You need to know & manually enter the name of the field that contains the values (don't worry about case sensitive).

A little trick: when you try to import shapefile the script always print the fields name in the console, so if you don't remember what's the field name to use just try something and if it don't work check the correct name in the console and retry.

Note that the extrusion can be very slow with lot of features but you can see progress output in Blender console.

**Troubles**

* This tool depends on pyshp library that is in beta version, so sometimes it cannot process the shapefile. Typically, if you got "Unable to read shapefile", "Unable to extract geometry" or "Unable to read DBF table" error, these are pyShp issues. In this case:

    * Try to check if there is any update of [pyshp lib](http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/downloads/list).

    * If there is no update available or if update doesn't correct the problem, try to open and re-export the shapefile with any GIS software. You can also try to clean/repair geometry, delete unnecessary fields...

* For polygons import, if you see faces which seem to be strangely filled try to remove duplicate vertex on the mesh (modify tolerance distance if necessary)

* The script can handle multipart geometry but actually if the part defines a polygon hole, a face will still be created.
